"""Detect tool-name collisions across connected MCP servers (COLLIDE-001).

When multiple servers advertise a tool with the same name, the AI agent's
tie-breaking behaviour is undocumented and order-dependent.  An attacker who
can publish or inject a server with a colliding tool name can shadow a trusted
tool — the agentic analogue of PATH poisoning.

Detection strategy:
  1. Collect all (ServerConfig, ServerEnumeration) pairs from a live --connect
     run.  Only pairs without enumeration errors are considered.
  2. Build a ``{tool_name: {server_identity: ServerConfig}}`` index.
  3. Any tool name claimed by two or more *distinct* server identities is a
     collision.  MEDIUM severity by default; HIGH when one claimant is in the
     known-server registry and at least one is not (unknown server shadowing a
     trusted one).

Scope: requires ``--connect``.  Static configs do not carry tool lists, so
this check cannot run without live enumeration.  This boundary is documented
in ``GAPS.md``.

    Algorithm:

    1. Filter to successfully connected pairs (``enumeration.error is None``).

    Deduplication: the same logical server configured in multiple MCP client
    config files (same ``name``/``command``/``args``/``url``) is counted as
    one claimant.  Tool-name comparison is case-sensitive.
